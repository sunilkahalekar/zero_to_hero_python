Python has many native datatypes. Here are the important ones:

Booleans are either True or False.
Numbers can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers.
Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an html document.
Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a jpeg image file.
Lists are ordered sequences of values.
Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of values.
Sets are unordered bags of values.
Dictionaries are unordered bags of key-value pairs.
